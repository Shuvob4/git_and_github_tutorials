        "2. It allows us tracking and managing changes to the code over the time\n",

        "time in the history\n",
        "4. It also has Collaboration aspects\n",
        "    - It allows multiple people working on the same project at once and \n",
        "    can modify group changes.\n",
        "    - Can share code for other's reviewing.\n",
        "    - Can track Who make the changes, What changes were made and When \n",

        "Commits and it's unique for every check point. It has a super cool feature like multiverse aka Branching, that lets us create\n",
        "an alternate version of our code. A branch is a copy of project and it's super useful when working in groups, allowing us the \n",
        "capability of working on with or without changing the original code. We can also synchronize the changes that happened across different\n",

        "\n",
        "The global option makes sure that every project in that local machine will use that name and email address.\n",

        "git config --list\n",

        "\n",
        "To see where the settings file are defined, we can run bellow command:\n",

        "# displaying setting files location command\n",
        "git config --list --show-origin\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Once we set up the global variables, we will initialize the project. To do so, we have to go to that directory from the command line.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. After initializing the git, we need to add the files in the staging environment with `git add` command. Staging is a temporary area\n",
        "that we can store files that we want to commit later.\n",

        "\n",

        "git commit -m \"Commit Message\"\n",

        "\n",
        "git commit message should be short and precise. What are the changes being made, why are the changes and the functionalities it will add.\n",
        "git commit message should be like email subject. \n",
        "\n",
        "`git commit` command will remove the `A` tag beside the files names in VS Code. It means these files has been committed into your local machine.\n",
        "Any changes made after this will flag the file as `M` tag. `M` means Modified. \n",
        "\n",
